## Projects

### Project 1 : Classification of Breast Cancer using Ultrasound Images

1. This project aims to develop an automated breast cancer classification system using deep learning techniques to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors from BUS images. The dataset is located in the `data/Breast data` directory.
2. The study will utilize the BUS-BRA Breast Ultrasound Dataset, which contains annotated ultrasound images with pathology-confirmed labels and lesion segmentation masks.
3. Preprocessing techniques : image `resizing`, `normalization`, and data `augmentation` will be applied to improve data quality and enhance model generalization.
4. A Convolutional Neural Network (`CNN`) or hybrid deep learning architecture will be used to automatically extract important features from the ultrasound images.
5. The trained model will classify the breast lesions into benign or malignant categories based on the learned features.
6. The performance of the proposed model will be evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
7. The developed system aims to assist radiologists by providing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool that improves diagnostic accuracy and supports early detection of breast cancer.


### Project 2 : Maternal Health Risk Prediction in Personalized Patient Care

1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The dataset is located in the `data/Pregnancy_risk` directory. Load the Excel file containing the maternal health dataset and conduct an initial exploration to understand its structure and contents.
2. Understand the dataset structure, data types, and basic statistics for each feature.
4. The dataset may include clinical features such as:- Age, Systolic Blood Pressure as SystolicBP, Diastolic BP as DiastolicBP, Blood Sugar as BS, Body Temperature as BodyTemp, HeartRate and RiskLevel. All these are the responsible and significant risk factors for high-risk pregnancies.
5. The project is divided into following parts:-
   - `Data Preprocessing and Cleaning`: A pre-processed dataset with no missing values or inconsistencies, ready for further analysis.
   - `Data Analysis` is including visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) and calculating correlations between features.
   - `Prediction Task`: Predicting Maternal Health Risk Level: Learn classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, and evaluate model performance.
   - Build a classification model to predict the risk level (low, medium, or high) based on the health features provided.
6. Model Tuning and Optimization : Optimize the classification model by tuning hyperparameters and using techniques such as cross-validation.
7. For report writing, compile the analysis, and results.
   

### Project 3 : Early Detection of Coronary Heart Disease

1. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system for early prediction of CHD using patient clinical and lifestyle data. The dataset is located in the `data/Heart data` directory.
2. The dataset contains attributes such as `age`, `gender`, `blood pressure`, `cholesterol level`, `smoking habits`, `glucose level`, and other risk factors.
3. The project is divided into following parts:-
   - `Data Preprocessing and Cleaning`: handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization will be applied to improve data quality and model performance.
   - `Data Analysis` is including visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) and calculating correlations between features.
   - `Prediction Task`: Predict the chances of heart disease in patients: Learn a classification algorithm such as logistic regression, and evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
4. The system can assist healthcare professionals by providing `early warnings for patients at risk of coronary heart disease`.
5. The proposed model aims to support preventive healthcare and clinical decision-making, helping reduce mortality through timely diagnosis and treatment.
